The feeling in Vim is incredible, but for the beginner like me , having to figure out how to install plugins , language support , etc ; make me become so lazy and be more into "GUI" IDE like visual studio. But today decided to focus on building my first project, which is customize Vim , i mean nvim with lua, because it seem to be a better extension after doing some research on how luna work :)
